<h2>About me</h2>
<p><em>I am passionate</em> about sports, <strong>specially Judo and Cross</strong> and <abbr title="CrossFit">C.R</abbr>, which I practice regularly to keep fit and challenge myself. These sports help me develop discipline, focus, and perseverance. In addition to these, I also love dancing, as it allows me to express myself creatively and unwind after a long day.</p>

<p>I was born in September, 09<sup>th</sup> 2002. As a proud Algerian Kabyle, my cultural heritage is very important to me. I take pride in my roots and enjoy celebrating my traditions and values. When I'm not busy with sports or dance, you can find me indulging in my love for food or relaxing with a good nap to recharge.</p>
